Working in progress
- Need to make some changes on the code

Beckham:
*I've updated the code with resizeable window and set the minimum size for it.

*The lastest Model.java code has no indentation problems, unused code and blanks had removed.

Vickey:
*The MVC design pattern done, I try my best to make it MVC DP but not quite sure. 

The code can run properly without any error. 

Haven't put in the resizeable window for the MVC code.
